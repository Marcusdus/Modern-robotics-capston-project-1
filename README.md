# Modern-robotics-capston-project-1
This project is to write software to control a mobile manipulator to pick up a block, carry it to a new configuration, and put it down.  To achieve this, our software will plan a multi-segment trajectory for the end-effector of the mobile manipulator; implement a feedback controller to drive the wheels and arm joints of the mobile manipulator; and simulate the mobile manipulator's motion given the wheel and joint velocities calculated by your controller.  This simulator will use odometry to simulate the motion of the chassis.
